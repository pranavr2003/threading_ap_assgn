## Multithreading in Python

1. For small input sizes, multi-threading is slower due to thread overhead. The benefits appear with larger datasets. Obviously the extent matters. Eg. In a high-spec PC, the definition of what is called a 'large dataset' varies when compared to a realatively average one.      

The `threading` module can be used to sort the left and right halves of the array concurrently in different threads. However, due to Pythonâ€™s GIL, true parallelism may not be achieved with CPU-bound tasks. Otherwise the base approach is the same as with the normal merge sort.

> Sample input (same as the one inside the main func):

```py   
size = 20000
data = [random.randint(1, 100000) for _ in range(size)]
```
> Sample Output:

```sh
gitpod /workspace/threading_ap_assgn (main) $ /home/gitpod/.pyenv/shims/python /workspace/threading_ap_assgn/qn1.py
Single-threaded time: 0.0528 seconds
Multi-threaded time: 0.0647 seconds
Output Correct: True
```

A large inpyt list was deliberately given in order to try and show multi-threading in action to the extent possible.

2. Here we create separate threads to sort the left and right partitions concurrently.We use a depth limit to avoid spawning too many threads. Same as before with small and large inputs. With large datasets, performace can improve depending on the thread depth. 

> Sample input: Same as before

> Sample output:

```sh
gitpod /workspace/threading_ap_assgn (main) $ /home/gitpod/.pyenv/shims/python /workspace/threading_ap_assgn/qn2.py       
Single-threaded time: 0.0307 seconds    
Multi-threaded time: 0.0351 seconds    
Output Correct: True      
```

3. Here, `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` was used. It uses ThreadPoolExecutor to limit the number of concurrent downloads and prints results as each file finishes downloading. 

> Sample input:

```sh
gitpod /workspace/threading_ap_assgn (main) $ /home/gitpod/.pyenv/shims/python /workspace/threading_ap_assgn/qn3.py

```

As we can see, the concurrent download time here on the second image `flower-gif-1` is better than the sequential dowload time on the same second image by exactly 0.06 secs.
